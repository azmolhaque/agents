# CindraLeads

Autonomous lead intelligence for Cindrasec. Runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 (16 GB).

## Absolute rules

1. **PASSIVE-ONLY.** Never write code that scans, probes, brute-forces, or authenticates
   against a prospect. Public-record and self-published lookups only. This is a legal
   boundary and the entire brand promise ("no scan without a signed RoE"), not a
   preference. See `PLAN.md` and `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` (Phase 5).
2. Every lead needs >= 1 Trigger with >= 1 reachable Evidence URL. **No evidence, no lead.**
3. Local model first. Cloud API is a rationed escalation path with a hard daily cap
   (`DAILY_CLOUD_USD_CAP`, default $0.50), persisted in SQLite, surviving restart.
4. Nothing crosses a stage boundary except a validated Pydantic model.
5. Secrets live in `.env`, are redacted in logs, and are never committed.
6. The Dispatcher writes to Discord. It **never** emails a prospect. A human decides.

## Commands

```
make install     # venv + dev extras
make test        # everything
make check       # lint + typecheck + test (what CI runs)
make gate        # Phase 0 acceptance: 100 jobs, kill -9, exactly once
make fmt         # ruff format + autofix
make schema      # regenerate db/schema.sql from db/migrations/

cindra db migrate | db status | db backup <path>
cindra queue status | queue reclaim | queue enqueue --kind K
cindra work --kinds K [--drain-inflight]
cindra feedback <lead_id> good|bad
```

## Conventions

Python 3.11+, asyncio, Pydantic v2, ruff + mypy strict, pytest.
Every network call: timeout, retry with jitter, circuit breaker.
Every LLM call: JSON Schema via Ollama `format`, parsed into Pydantic, retried once at
temp 0, then escalated, then dead-lettered. **Never regex a model's prose into a field.**
Prefer stdlib and small arm64-native deps. Justify anything over ~200 MB.

## Approved deviations from the master prompt

These are decided; do not "fix" them back. Rationale in `PLAN.md` Part 2.

- **No `qwen3:1.7b` router.** Three models contend for two Ollama load slots. Two
  resident models only: `qwen3:4b-instruct` + `bge-m3`.
- **`anthropic` SDK, not `claude-agent-sdk`** in prod (100 MB and wants Node, for an
  agent loop we do not use). `claude-agent-sdk` is dev-extra only.
- **Dedupe rungs 1/2/4 ship; the vector rung is gated off** behind config. `sqlite-vec`
  and `company_vectors` exist from day one so enabling it is never a migration.
- **Discord feedback needs a gateway bot** (Phase 8). Webhooks are write-only and
  cannot read reactions; `dispatch_log.discord_message_id` exists for the join.
- **6 fetches per domain per 24 h**, >= 3 s apart (the spec's "<=2/day" contradicted its
  own 5-path fetch list).
- **`T0_INBOUND`** added to the trigger taxonomy so inbound mail becomes a real Lead.

## Where things are

```
config/*.yaml   behaviour - edit these, not code       prompts/        all LLM prompts
db/migrations/  schema source of truth                 db/schema.sql   generated, do not edit
src/cindraleads/  pipeline                             mcp_servers/    tools (library + MCP wrapper)
tests/golden/   regression fixtures for prompt changes docs/RUNBOOK.md what to do at 3am
```

## Testing rules

- Never change a prompt without re-running the golden fixtures.
- Every rule in the compliance section gets its own test. CI fails on a missing one.
- The durability drill (`make gate`) spawns real processes and sends real SIGKILLs.
  If you make it pass by weakening it, you have deleted the reason the queue exists.

## Current state

**Phase 0 complete.** Models, store, durable queue, structlog + redaction, CLI skeleton,
CI. Phase 1 (Ollama, `thermal.py`, `llm.py`, benchmarks) is next and not yet started.
